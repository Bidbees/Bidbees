👋 Hi, I’m @Bidbees

👀 I’m interested in ...
Building the ultimate construction tender and estimating platform using first principles. I'm focused on creating a highly performant, scalable, and intelligent system that revolutionizes how construction projects are priced and managed, adhering to standards like JBCC, SANS, and COLTO.

🌱 I’m currently learning ...
Deep diving into Bun runtime for high-performance backend services, designing and implementing complex database schemas (like the one we've built in PostgreSQL/Supabase), integrating diverse data stores (MongoDB, Redis, Vector databases), building resilient microservices, implementing message queues (Kafka) for batch processing, and leveraging Machine Learning (TensorFlow, Vectorise.ai) for intelligent features like tender matching and price prediction. I'm also exploring modern frontend development with Next.js and efficient data management with tools like Payload CMS and NocoDB.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
This is a large and exciting project! I'm actively seeking collaboration on:
*   **Backend Development:** Building robust and scalable microservices with Bun and integrating various databases.
*   **Frontend Development:** Creating intuitive and dynamic user interfaces (Tenderer Portal, Supplier Portal, Admin Dashboard) with Next.js.
*   **ML Engineering:** Developing, training, and deploying ML models for tender suggestions, supplier recommendations, and price validation.
*   **Construction Domain Expertise:** Validating estimating workflows, BOQ rules, and data requirements specific to different standards (JBCC, SANS, COLTO).
*   **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Setting up and optimizing deployment pipelines (CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Docker) and cloud infrastructure (AWS, Cloudflare).
*   **UI/UX Design:** Crafting a user-friendly experience for complex estimating tasks.

📫 How to reach me ...
The best way to reach me is by opening an issue on one of my project repositories or connecting with me via bidbees23@gmail.com.

⚡ Fun fact: ...
A detailed construction estimate for a large project can sometimes contain more individual cost lines than there are LEGO bricks in a large LEGO set! Building them requires just as much precision.
